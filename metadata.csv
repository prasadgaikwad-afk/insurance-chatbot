For Limited / Regular Pay Policy - Once the policy becomes reduced paid-up, the 
maturity and death benefit payouts shall be computed by multiplying the 
death/maturity payouts as specified in “Benefits in detail” section to the ratio of the 
premiums paid to the premiums payable under the policy. Under the Guaranteed 
Maturity option, no further Guaranteed Additions shall accrue in the future. The 
Guaranteed Additions accrued till the date of paid-up shall continue to remain 
attached.
Surrender:
The Policyholder may surrender the policy during the Policy Term. 
The Surrender Benefit will be higher of GSV (Guaranteed Surrender Value) and SSV 
(Special Surrender Value).
The policy shall acquire a Guaranteed Surrender Value (GSV) immediately on the 
payment of Single Premium and upon the payment of at least first two years’ premiums 
in case of a Limited/ Regular Premium Policy.
The minimum GSV shall be the sum of:
a) the GSV of the total premiums paid and
b) the Surrender Value of the Guaranteed Additions, already accrued to the policy, if 
applicable."
pdf1,"Where,
the GSV of the total premiums paid shall be determined as the applicable GSV factors 
on total premiums paid at the time of surrender multiplied to the total premiums paid 
to date. The premium is excluding any taxes and levies paid as applicable or any extra 
premiums paid.
the Surrender Value of the Guaranteed Additions paid shall be determined as the 
applicable GSV factors on the Guaranteed Addition at the time of surrender 
multiplied to the Guaranteed Additions already accrued to the policy (applicable to 
Plan Option: Guaranteed Maturity).
For details on GSV percentage, please refer “Terms and Conditions” section below. 
Special Surrender Value (SSV) shall become payable after completion of first policy year 
provided one full year premium has been received. For single premium policies, SSV shall 
become payable immediately after receipt of single premium. On payment of the 
Surrender Benefit, the policy will terminate and no more benefits will be payable.
Revival:
If your Policy has been discontinued due to the non-payment of Premium, it would be 
revived /restored by the Insurer with all the benefits mentioned in the Policy document, 
with or without rider benefits, if any, upon the receipt of all the Premiums due and other 
charges/late fee, if any, during the revival period, as per the terms and conditions of the 
Policy, upon being satisfied as to the continued insurability of the insured/Policyholder on 
the basis of the information, documents and reports furnished by the Policyholder; in 
accordance with Board approved Underwriting Policy. Currently, the application for the 
revival should be made within five years from the due date of the first unpaid Premium 
and before the expiry of the Policy Term. The current rate of interest for revival is 9.5% p.a. 
Any change in the revival interest rates will be in accordance with the following formula: 
Average Annualised 10-year benchmark G-Sec Yield (over last 6 months & rounded upto 
the nearest 50 bps) + 2%, at the time of the review. The source of 10-year benchmark 
G-sec yield shall be RBI Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching segment (NDS-OM).
During revival campaigns, the Company may offer reduced interest rates, subject to the 
rules of the special revival campaign. The reduced interest rates offered during the 
revival campaign may vary from year to year. The maximum interest rate waiver may be 
set up to the prevailing revival interest rate. Once the Policy is revived, you are entitled to 
receive all contractual Benefits."

pdf2,"1. Why do I need Health Insurance?
 Healthcare is expensive. Technological advances, new procedures and more effective medicines have driven up the 
cost of healthcare. This increase has to be borne by the consumer, making treatment unaffordable for too many. 
Health Insurance overcomes these obstacles so that you remain free of anxiety regarding your health. Think for a 
moment about the enormous medical costs you would incur if you suffered a major accident tomorrow or were 
suddenly stricken by an illness. Uninsured people live with such risks everyday. Health insurance seeks to shield you 
from that risk. It provides the much needed financial relief. You also get tax benefit under section 80D of the Income 
Tax Act and amendments made thereto.
2. How will health insurance pay for my emergency medical expenses?
 Your health insurance will either pay your hospital bills directly if opted for the cashless facility or it will reimburse 
any payment made by you towards medical expenses incurred due to an illness or injury as per the policy terms.
3. What do you mean by Family Floater Policy?
 Family Floater is one single policy that takes care of the hospitalization expenses of your entire family. The policy has 
one single sum insured, which can be utilized by any/all insured persons in any proportion or amount subject to 
maximum of overall limit of the policy sum insured, as per policy terms and conditions. 
4. Will my health insurance cover begin from day one?
 When you get a new policy, there will be a 30 days waiting period starting from the policy inception date, during 
which period any hospitalization charges will not be payable by the insurance companies. However, this is not 
applicable to any emergency hospitalization occurring due to an accident. This waiting period will not be applicable 
for subsequent policies under renewal. Furthermore, in the case of a declared & accepted pre-existing disease or 
specific diseases, you will have to serve the waiting period of 2 years for these diseases / conditions. 
5. What is pre-existing condition in health insurance policy?
 It is a medical condition/disease that existed before you obtained health insurance policy
6. If my policy is not renewed in time before expiry date, will it be denied for renewal?
 The policy will be renewable provided you pay the premium within 30 days (called as Grace Period) of expiry date. 
However, coverage would not be available for the period for which no premium is received by Us. The policy will 
lapse if the premium is not paid within the grace period.
7. What happens to the policy coverage after a claim is filed?
 After a claim is filed and settled, the policy coverage is reduced by the amount that has been paid out on settlement. 
For Example: In January you start a policy with a coverage of `5 Lakh for the year. In April, you make a claim of `2 
Lakh. The coverage available to you for the May to December will be the balance of `3 Lakh.
8. What is Unlimited Reset Benefit?
 It is a benefit that allows an insured to reinstate the entire sum insured in the policy year when it gets exhausted 
due to incurred claims. In case the entire cover is exhausted, it gets replenished automatically for the next 
hospitalization that occurs within the policy year. Reset will not trigger on first claim and cannot be used by same 
person for same illness for which the claim has already been paid in the policy.
9. Does my policy offer worldwide cover?
 Basis the plan and add on selected, Complete Health Insurance policy covers Hospitalization expenses incurred 
abroad with a co-pay of 10%
10. What is covered under Domiciliary Hospitalization?
 Domiciliary Hospitalization offers coverage for medical expenses in a situation where the Insured Person is in such 
a state that he/she cannot be moved to a hospital or the treatment is taken at home if there's a non-availability of 
room in the hospital.
11. What is Super No Claim Bonus?
 In case the customer has opted for this additional cover with extra premium, there will be a 50% bonus awarded for 
every claim free year subject to a maximum of 100% for SI options up to 10 Lakhs and up to 200% for SI options 15 
Lakhs and above.
12. What is the maximum Sum Insured under the new plans?
 All plans come with multiple Sum Insured options up to a maximum of 50 Lakhs
13. Can I increase my Sum Insured at the time of renewal?
 Yes, you can increase the Sum Insured at the time of renewal. However, fresh waiting period would apply for the 
enhanced Sum Insured (this condition would not apply on the original sum insured including the accrued Additional 
Sum insured)
